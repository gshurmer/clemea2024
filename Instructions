Pre-requisites
==============

Webex Connect sandbox tenant
AirTable account
Postman
Webhook catcher (webhooksite / requestcatcher / similar)

Step 1 - Webex Connect sandbox
==============================

Visit https://cpaas.webex.com/products/webex-connect/sandbox and follow instructions.

Step 2 - CLEMEA Reference materials
===================================

Visit https://www.ciscolive.com/emea/learn/session-catalog.html and search for gavin or 2956.
You will need to be signed in to access the resources.

Step 3 - Configuring AirTable
==============================

Use an online API-enabled data repository.  I used AirTable.
To see the table structure to replicate: https://airtable.com/appf6rR8GCMAfManb/shr95tfdCkn5ZWidd
Copy the relevant tokens (for AirTable it is Base ID, Table ID and access Token.

Step 4 - Starting with the core flow: CLEMEA Delivery Notifications Published
=============================================================================
Create a Service

Create a new flow
  Chose to upload a flow, name is as CLEMEA Delivery Notifications
  Drop the file CLEMEA Delivery Notifications Published.workflow into the file upload window

Configure the webhook (see step4a.jpg)
  Select Create a new event
  Give the new event a name - i.e. clemea_delivery_notifications_event_trigger
  Copy the webhook URL for configuring Postman later
  Define the trigger payload as:
    {
      "DeliveryID": "1234"
    }
  Parse the payload
  Save the node
Set the Custom Variables (see step4b.jpg)
  Use your AirTable (or other DB) tokens as per step 3 above.

Update HTTP node "OMS Check" (see step4c.jpg)
  If you used AirTable as your db, no change is needed to the HTTP Node "OMS CHeck" 
  Else update the http call configuration as required.

Configure the SMS Node (see step4d.jpg)
  The Sandbox tenant does not have an email asset configured, so to create the channel failover logic I used SMS as the fallback channel.
  It needs to be cofigured as per step4d.jpg.
  $(primarycontactinfo) param can be found under the http node output vars.

Configure the Receive nodes (step4e.jpg)
  Open and save the receive nodes to confirm the configurations.

Step 5 - Configuring Postman
============================

Instructions for the remaining two flows to follow shortly.  The above should get the main flow working.
